# Zimbabwean Exchange Rate Prediction Project

## Description
This project aims to predict the exchange rate of the Zimbabwean Dollar (ZWL) against the US Dollar (USD) using machine learning algorithms.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook




## Folder Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and modeling.
- `src/`: Source code for scripts and modules.
- `models/`: Saved trained machine learning models.
- `reports/`: Documentation, reports, and visualizations.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.

## Data Sources
- Historical exchange rate data obtained from [source].

## Modeling Approach
- Used scikit-learn to train regression models, including linear regression and random forests.

## Results
- Achieved an accuracy of X% on the test dataset.
